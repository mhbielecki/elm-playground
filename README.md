# Elm - A delightful language for reliable webapps.

## Elm
Elm is a domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises "no runtime exceptions in practice", made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_(programming_language))

## This repo
Nothing fancy, just a collection of small projects/examples related to learning and playing around with [the Elm language](https://elm-lang.org/).

Use the [Ellie app - The Live Elm Editor](https://ellie-app.com/) to run the code samples.
